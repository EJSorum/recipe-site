Veggies First

This app uses the spoonacular.com API to search recipes by ingredients. By pressing one of the veggie buttons, the user gets a list of recipes using that vegetable.

"Veggies First" is my approach to cooking. Instead of considering what the protein will be, or what cuisine you're craving, "Veggies First" means you first ask yourself what veggies you'll be eating.

This ensures not only that you eat healthy, but leads to craving vegetables by considering what vegetable sounds good to you. Maybe those green beans at the farmer's market look absolutely delicious, or maybe tomatoes are in season. With just one click, "Veggies First" provides a long list of recipe suggestions for inspiration. Far from being a regretable side-dish, veggies just became your #1 favorite.

Most recipe sites require significant loading, ad closing, and scrolling just to view one recipe. By extracting only the most essential data from JSON files, Veggies First provides an image, the ingredients, and instructions for dozens of recipes in an instant.

Features also include a set of buttons to choose how many recipes to list in the search, and a search bar to find recipes for any ingredient.

Veggies First

This app uses the spoonacular.com API to search recipes by ingredients.  Pressing the veggie buttons is a quick way to get ideas for eating healthy foods.

"Veggies First" is my approach to cooking.  Instead of considering what the main course will be, what the protein will be, or what cuisine you're craving, "Veggies First" means you ask yourself what veggies you'll be eating.

This ensures not only that you eat healthy, but you are pivoting towards the vegetables that look good to you today, or are currently in season.  Maybe those tomatoes at the farmer's market look absolutely delicious, or you see some perfectly ripe avocados at the super market.  Or maybe you just have some cabbage leftover you don't know what to do with.  With just one click, "Veggies First" provides a long list of recipe suggestions for inspiration.  Far from being a regretable side-dish, veggies just became your #1 favorite.
